## Specialized Infrastructure & Testing Solutions

I help organizations build reliable, reproducible systems through declarative infrastructure, secure embedded computing, and robust automated testing. With deep expertise in Nix, Rust, Linux kernel development, and OP-TEE, I solve complex technical challenges that require both systems-level knowledge and modern DevOps practices.

## What I Offer

### Declarative Infrastructure with Nix

Transform your build and deployment pipelines into reproducible, maintainable systems. I leverage Nix to create infrastructure that eliminates "works on my machine" problems and makes your entire stack versionable and auditable.

**I can help you:**
- Design and implement Nix-based CI/CD pipelines that guarantee reproducible builds across environments
- Migrate legacy build systems to declarative Nix configurations
- Create custom NixOS modules for your specific infrastructure needs
- Build containerized and VM-based testing environments that spin up instantly
- Develop reproducible development environments that work identically for every team member

### Automated Testing & Quality Assurance

Drawing on recent work automating testing for Linux-based kiosk systems, I build comprehensive testing frameworks that catch issues before they reach production.

**Services include:**
- Multi-service integration testing with automated orchestration
- Kiosk and embedded system testing automation
- Continuous testing pipelines integrated with your existing tools
- Test environment provisioning that mirrors production exactly

### Secure Embedded Systems

With specialized knowledge of OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment), I help you implement security at the hardware level for IoT, embedded devices, and secure computing applications.

**Expertise in:**
- OP-TEE integration and trusted application development
- Hardware-backed cryptographic operations

### Systems Programming & Performance

Built on a foundation of Rust and Linux kernel expertise, I can optimize your critical systems code for performance, reliability, and security.

**I specialize in:**
- Rust development for systems where reliability is non-negotiable
- Linux kernel driver development and debugging
- Memory-safe refactoring of critical C codebases
- Cross-platform systems software

## Who I Work With

My work typically fall into these categories:

- **DevOps and Platform** needing reproducible infrastructure and advanced automation
- **Embedded Systems** building secure IoT devices, kiosks, or edge computing platforms
- **Security-Focused** requiring trusted execution environments and hardware-level security
- **Products** struggling with flaky tests, unreproducible builds, or complex multi-service architectures

## Engagement Models

**Consulting Projects** - Fixed-scope work with clear deliverables, typically 2-8 weeks. Ideal for migrations, proof-of-concepts, or building specific infrastructure.

**Retainer Arrangements** - Ongoing support and development for teams that need regular access to specialized expertise.

**Architecture Review** - Focused engagement to evaluate your current systems and provide detailed recommendations with implementation roadmaps.

## Why Work With Me

The technologies I specialize in—Nix, OP-TEE, Rust, and kernel development—represent a rare combination of skills. You're not just getting someone who knows these tools; you're getting someone who understands how to combine them to solve real-world problems in testing, security, and infrastructure.

I focus on building systems that are maintainable by your team after I'm gone, not creating dependencies on external expertise. Every engagement includes knowledge transfer, documentation, and clear explanations of architectural decisions.

## Let's Talk

If you're facing challenges with reproducible builds, complex testing scenarios, embedded security, or systems-level performance, I'd like to hear about them.
