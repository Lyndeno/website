I offer software consulting services for software development. I specialize in Nix and Rust.

I can help you develop your continuous integration pipeline utilizing Nix for caching and reproducibility. I have experience creating development shells, software packages, and virtual environments with QEMU to allow easy protyping of entire systems.

I have interest in the Rust programming language. I have used Rust to interface with dbus. I also have experience writing Linux kernel modules in C.

If you are interested in my services, please contact me at [consulting@lyndeno.ca](mailto:consulting@lyndeno.ca)
