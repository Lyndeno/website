I am offering a tech help service for anyone who needs assistance with their systems. I have no set fees so you can contact me at [tech@lyndeno.ca](mailto:tech@lyndeno.ca).

I have knowledge and can assist in the following systems:

- Windows Computers
- MacOS Computers
- Some Linux systems
- Apple iPhone
- Android Phones
- Windows Phones

With most of these systems I can also remote control your system which makes it easier to assist. We can discuss times for that if needed. I can help with many problems regarding these systems; these issues could include viruses, slow performance, as well as other problems, or if you just need help in other areas.
